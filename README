This directory contains necessary script files to export content from a Drupal 5
database and import it into a Drupal 6 site. The migration phase is generally
broken into 3 separate steps: initializing, importing, and processing.

The initialization phase should only happen once, but the importing and
processing phases may be run multiple times. It is advisable to do a preliminary
migration during site development to test for integration bugs, and to do a
final migration in the moments before a site relaunch.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

 * This script requires Drush. Drush is installed on our development and
   production servers. Our development server is wbrlabs.com. Our production
   server is mgmt1.p.wbrdc.com. To learn more about Drush, visit
   http://drupal.org/project/drush

 * Before the preliminary migration, a snapshot of the production site database
   needs to be setup on the dev server with the same db access credentials as
   the dev site.

 * Before the site launch, the production site must be put in a frozen state or
   be taken offline. At this time, a snapshot of the production database should
   be setup on the dev server with the same db access credentials as the dev
   site.

SETUP
-----

1. COPY THE SCRIPT FILES TO A SPECIFIED LOCATION.

   Do not edit the versioned files directly, unless you plan to permanently
   change the migration script in the repository. Copy or svn export these files
   to a new location.  A good candidate is the site project directory:

	   svn export http://svn.warnerreprise.com/projects/contentmig \
	   path/to/sites/site/contentmig
	
2. SETUP SNAPSHOT OF PRODUCTION SITE DATABASE

3. EDIT CONFIG FILE WITH AUTO-INCREMENT VALUES
